Day 7. Networking in Practice.

What I did today: 
- Try Hack Me OSI Models lesson.
- Practiced commands for networking in terminal.
- Understood what ports are, why open ports is risk, and why networking is the first step in penetration.

What I learned today:
- How to view interfaces, IP addresses and their states, devices, what routes does computer choses in network. 
- How to see who is listening to the network.
- How to test if host is alive.
- How to trace routes between me and goal.
- What is an OSI Model, and what 7 modules does it consists of.
- What each of these ports does and what their advantages and disadvantages are.

Commands learned today:
- ip route - what route does computer choses in the network.
- ip a - shows all the networking interfaces, ip addresses, and their state.
- ip neigh - show ARP. Devices near me, IP to MAC correlations.
- ss -tulnp - who is listening to the network (-t > TCP, -u > UDP, -l > listening, -n > without DNS, -p > proccess)
- ping 8.8.8.8 - tests if host is alive and working, checks the network.
- traceroute (website) - traces all the routes between you and the goal.
- hostname -I - shows IP address without anything else.
- curl ifconfig.me - shows external IP
